# Waste Classification using CNN

## Problem
Incorrect waste disposal leads to environmental and environmental issues. This project aims to automatically classify waste types using computer vision and deep learning.

## Solution
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to classify waste images into multiple categories and associate them with the correct disposal container.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Dataset
Custom dataset containing images of different waste categories such as plastic, paper, glass, metal, organic, and hazardous waste.

## Model
- CNN architecture for multi-class classification
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Train/validation split

## Results
- Multi-class waste classification with satisfactory validation accuracy
- Visual evaluation using sample predictions

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
